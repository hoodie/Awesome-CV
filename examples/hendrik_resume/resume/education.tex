          This thesis explores interaction techniques to enable the exploration of complex 4D data sets using natural user interfaces.
          The technology is based on libavg, which was also employed for study thesis.
          The 4D datasets are SPIM imagery, by courtesy of MPI-CGB.

        This thesis discusses several interaction design concepts,
        which are meant to support different sensemaking subtasks.
        A multi-device prototype application has been developed,
        which uses a wall-sized multitouch display and handheld devices.
        combining familiar features of an active reading application with a document collection- and exploration- visualization for wall sized displays.
